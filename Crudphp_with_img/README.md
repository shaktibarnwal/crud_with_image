2. Create a database named `crud_app`.
3. Import the `Cruddb.sql` file (if provided) into your database, or create a `users` table with `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age` columns.
4. Place the application files in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
5. Configure the database connection in `db/db.php`.
